1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,135
Now that you've learned to use Git to control the version

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:05,835
of both your local and remote repositories,

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:08,065
it's time to put your skills to work.

4
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:11,040
In this project, you will simulate the workflow used in

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,895
industry on the bike share code you completed for the previous project.

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:18,325
Now, there will be four main parts to this project.

7
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:23,500
First, you'll set up your repository on both your local machine and then up on GitHub.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,390
Then, you'll improve the documentation on a documentation branch.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,235
Third, you'll refactor your code on a refactoring branch.

10
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:36,965
The actual part of your code that you choose to refactor for this doesn't really matter.

11
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:39,830
Finally, you'll need to merge all of your branches

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,375
together and add the changes to the remote repository.

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:47,030
The following pages will lead you through this process and inform

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,200
you about what the guidelines are for submission. Good luck.
